# House Sales in King County, USA

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on house sales in King County, USA. The dataset includes information on home sales between May 2014 and May 2015. The goal of this project is to explore the factors that influence house prices and to build a predictive model to estimate house sale prices based on these factors.

## Project Overview

The project involves:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values, transforming variables, and addressing outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Modeling:** Using machine learning algorithms to predict house prices.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). It contains 21,613 observations and 21 features, including:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each house.
- `date`: Date of the house sale.
- `price`: Price of the house (target variable).
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms.
- `sqft_living`: Square footage of the living space.
- `sqft_lot`: Square footage of the lot.
- `floors`: Number of floors.
- `waterfront`: Binary variable indicating whether the house has a waterfront view.
- `view`: Quality of the view from the house.
- And other features like `condition`, `grade`, `yr_built`, etc.

   ```

4. **Run the notebooks**: You can open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.

## Features and Models

### Feature Engineering

- **Log transformation**: Applied to features like `price` and `sqft_living` to reduce skewness.
- **Polynomial features**: Created interaction terms and polynomial features for some variables.

### Models

- **Linear Regression**: Baseline model for price prediction.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble model used for better performance.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Used to fine-tune and improve accuracy.
- **XGBoost**: Applied for optimal performance with hyperparameter tuning.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using:

- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error
- **R² Score**: Coefficient of determination to assess goodness of fit.

## Results

The best performing model achieved:

- **RMSE**: `xxxx`
- **R² Score**: `xx%`

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning models can be used to predict house prices based on various features. The most influential features include `sqft_living`, `grade`, and `zipcode`.
